# A-Generative-AI-Driven-Multi-Fusion-Transformer-Approach-for-Video-Captioning

Video captioning is complex. It is not just about generating a sentence; it requires understanding what is really happening across vision and sound. Every detail matters. Earlier encoder–decoder models tried, but they mostly relied on visual frames. They captured objects and movements but often ignored the audio, missing the mood, the context, and the subtle cues that complete the story. The result? Captions felt shallow and incomplete, limiting their usefulness for tasks like content search, summarization, indexing, and accessibility.
This research takes a different path. It leverages a bootstrapped BLIP-based transformer model enhanced with a multi-fusion mechanism. The system brings together video frames, audio features (MFCCs), and contextual tokens into a unified representation. BLIP provides strong vision-language grounding, while the audio-guided fusion ensures that captions stay context-aware and relevant. The result is a model that listens, watches, and captures meaning beyond surface-level objects.
And the payoff? Captions that are richer, clearer, and more human-like. The system not only describes but tells the story — making it valuable for media indexing, auto-summarization, and accessibility support for visually impaired users. The study also highlights practical challenges such as dataset diversity and overlapping events, yet demonstrates that a BLIP-based multi-fusion approach can push captioning systems beyond traditional limitations, pointing toward the future of video understanding.
